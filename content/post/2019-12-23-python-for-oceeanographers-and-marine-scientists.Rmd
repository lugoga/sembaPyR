During the last couple of decades, Matlab has been the most commonly-used scripting language in physical oceanography, and it has a large user base in many other fields--- however, Python has been gaining ground, often being adopted by former Matlab users as well as by newcomers. Here is a little background to help you understand this shift, and why we advocate using Python from the start.

Python was designed by a computer scientist as a general--purpose scripting language for easy adoption and widespread use. People tried it and liked it, and the result is that it is widely used throughout the software world, for all sorts of tasks, large and small. There is a vast array of Python packages that are freely available to do all sorts of things—including the sorts of things that oceanographers and other scientists do; but these packages are not neatly bound up in a single product, and the documentation for the language itself and for the packages is similarly scattered and of varying quality.

Why use Python instead of Matlab?
Python is fundamentally a better computer language in many ways.

i. It is suitable for a wider variety of tasks.
i. It scales better from the shortest of scripts to large software projects.
i. It facilitates writing clearer and more concise code.
i. With associated tools, it makes for easier access to existing high-performance codes in compiled languages, and for using smaller pieces of compiled code to speed up critical sections.
i. Because Python is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), you can install it on any machine without having to deal with a license manager.
i. For the same reason, Python code that is part of a research project can be run by anyone, anywhere, to verify or extend the results.
i. Most Python packages you are likely to want to use are developed in an open environment. The scientific Python ecosystem is dynamic and friendly.

What are the potential disadvantages?

i. Installation of all the packages one needs can take time and expertise; but distributions like Anaconda, combined with other improvements in python packaging software and repositories, are rapidly solving this problem.
i. Although progress is being made, the scientific Python stack is not as uniformly well-documented as Matlab; it might take longer to figure out how to do something in Python. You might also find that a routine available in Matlab is not yet available in a Python package.
i. Matlab is still mainstream in oceanography–at least among many of the old guard; with Python, you are an early adopter. (If you have a spirit of adventure, this might be considered an advantage.)

What about R?
The R language (and its commercial counterpart, S) is specialized for statistical calculations and plots. It is widely used in the social sciences but it is less suitable than Python for general computing in oceanography. If one has a need for some of its statistical capabilities, they can be accessed from Python using the interface module, Rpy2.


```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=""}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
require(reticulate)
use_python("c:/Python/Anaconda3/")


```

```{python}
import netCDF4 as nc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
# from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

```

```{python}
sst = nc.Dataset("e:/MatlabWorking/GHRSST/20150101.nc")
```

```{python}
sst.variables
```


```{python}
time = sst.variables['time']
lon = sst.variables['lon']
lat = sst.variables['lat']
data = sst.variables['analysed_sst']

```

```{python}
data.dimensions
```


```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1)
plt.imshow(data[0,:,:]-273,)
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

We noticed that the data is flipped upside down. we need to correct and map it in the correct orientation. we use `np.flipud` function from numpy module for correcting the orientation
```{python}

datar = np.flipud(data[0,:,:]-273)

fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1)
plt.imshow(datar, cmap = "jet")
plt.colorbar()
plt.clim(5,30)
plt.show()
```


```{python, eval = FALSE}
# import dependencies
import os
os.environ['PROJ_LIB'] = 'C:/Python/Anaconda3/Lib/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/basemap'
# note that Basemap will be supported until 2020 only
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


# make sure to set your plot size before you start rendering to screen
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
# by default, only crude and low resolutions are installed, if you wanted
# higher fidelity images, refer to the documentation.
default_map = Basemap(projection='ortho', lat_0=45, lon_0=-105,
                     resolution='l', area_thresh=1000.0)
default_map.drawcoastlines()
default_map.drawcountries() 
# matplotlib provides color creation 
default_map.fillcontinents(color='navajowhite')
default_map.drawmapboundary()
plt.show()

```


read data from local file as pandas data frame and print the five records
```{python}

## 
scot = pd.read_csv("e:/Data Manipulation/rpy/scottish_hills.csv")
scot.head()
```

Because of the error we experience in mapping with the `basemap` package, I will switch to an aternate module called `cartopy`. Unfortunately, Cartopy is not installed with Anaconda and you need to install  it in your machine. The easiest way to install Cartopy on your own computer is with the package manager conda which you can access by typing into a terminal:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
conda install -c conda-forge cartopy
```


Then you can load the modules in the session
```{python}

import cartopy.crs as ccrs
from cartopy.mpl.ticker import LongitudeFormatter, LatitudeFormatter
import cartopy.feature as cfeature

```

Then the chunk below 
```{python}

plt.figure(figsize=(2.5,2.5))
ax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.Mercator())
ax.coastlines('10m')

ax.xaxis.set_visible(True)
ax.yaxis.set_visible(True)

ax.set_yticks([56,57,58,59], crs=ccrs.PlateCarree())
ax.set_xticks([-8, -6, -4, -2], crs=ccrs.PlateCarree())

lon_formatter = LongitudeFormatter(zero_direction_label=True)
lat_formatter = LatitudeFormatter()

ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(lon_formatter)
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(lat_formatter)

ax.set_extent([-8, -1.5, 55.3, 59])


plt.scatter(scot['Longitude'],scot['Latitude'],
                    color='red', marker='^', transform=ccrs.PlateCarree())
plt.show()
# plt.savefig("munros.png")


```
